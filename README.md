## Abstract
Over the past few years, the scale of sensor networks has greatly expanded. This generates 1
extended spatio-temporal datasets, which form a crucial information resource in numerous fields, 2
ranging from sports and healthcare to environmental science and surveillance. Unfortunately, these 3
datasets often contain missing values, due to systematic or inadvertent sensor misoperation. This 4
incompleteness hampers the subsequent data analysis, yet addressing these missing observations 5
forms a challenging problem. This is especially the case when both the temporal correlation of 6
timestamps within a single sensor as well as the spatial correlation between sensors are important. 7
Here, we compare 12 imputation methods to complete the missing values in a dataset originating 8
from large-scale environmental monitoring. As part of a large citizen science project, IoT-based 9
microclimate sensors were deployed for 6 months in 4400 gardens across the region of Flanders, 10
generating 15 minute recordings of temperature and soil moisture. Methods based on spatial recovery 11
as well as time-based imputation were evaluated, including Spline Interpolation, MissForest, MICE, 12
MCMC, M-RNN, BRITS, and others. The performance of these imputation methods was evaluated for 13
different proportions of missing data (ranging from 10% to 50%), as well as a realistic missing value 14
scenario. Techniques leveraging the spatial features of the data tend to outperform the time-based 15
methods, with matrix completion techniques providing the best performance. Our results hence 16
provide a tool to maximize the benefit from costly, large-scale environmental monitoring efforts.
